# Jade_Spotify
### This is a repository focused on visualising personal Spotify data.

First you need to get your secret keys from the Spotify developper dashboard, which you can find here https://developer.spotify.com/

Once you have these, create a separate python file which lists your client ID, client secret and redirect uri.

With this you can install the requirements file to install the necessary libraries needed.
